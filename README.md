# Stream-of-Characters
Challenge at LeetCode.com. Tags: Trie, Design, Data Stream, Array, String.


This problem is solved in two versions, for the following programming languages: Java, JavaScript, C++.

-  Version one, contained in files StreamChecker.java, StreamChecker.js and StreamChecker.cpp, 
    applies the in-built data structures of each respective language for storing the stream of characters.

-  Version two, contained in files StreamCheckerWithCircularArray.java, StreamCheckerWithCircularArray.js and StreamCheckerWithCircularArray.cpp, 
    applies a custom made circular array, specifically tailored to the requirements of the problem, for storing the stream of characters.

Although the runtime might vary slightly for one and the same code, the version with a circular array, on average, improves the runtime as measured on leetcode.com, for each corresponding language.

A short demonstration of the circular array is contained in the files CircularArray.java, CircularArray.js and CircularArray.cpp.
